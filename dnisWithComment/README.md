# DNIS With Comment

This is designed to show a DNIS level report with the `comment` from the DID Pool on the item. This require each number to be in its own DID Pool so each can have its own name/comment. This is also a good example of how you can then create your own metrics if required, I have put in some of the OOTB metrics. You select the date range followed by the Survey form then the version of the form you want to reference.
