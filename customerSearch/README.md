# Customer Search

This is designed to allow for searching a larger date range at the one time. Values that you can search on are:

- ani (caller ID)
- remote (email))
- externalTag

This then also allows for downloading the data into a csv file as part of the standard template i use. If you need to add additional columns you can easily do this by adding it to the code. This is designed as an example to get you started.
